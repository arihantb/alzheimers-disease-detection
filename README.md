# Alzheimer's Disease Detection

![Header](image.png)

## Project Overview

In our third-year project, we designed and developed a mobile game specifically crafted to assess the navigating skills of users. The primary objective was to predict the probability of Alzheimer's Disease based on a dataset generated by the game.

## Project Significance

Focused on early detection, the Alzheimer's Disease Detection project holds immense significance in the realm of healthcare. By leveraging a mobile game to test navigating skills, the project aimed to provide a non-intrusive and accessible means of identifying potential indicators of Alzheimer's Disease in older adults.

## Technologies Used

The project employed C# programming language and the Unity game engine for the development of the mobile game. Ensemble Learning techniques were utilized for the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease based on the generated dataset.

## Project Workflow

1. **Mobile Game Development:** A mobile game was designed to test and assess the navigating skills of users.
2. **Data Generation:** The game collected data related to user interaction and behavior, forming the basis of the dataset for analysis.
3. **Ensemble Learning:** Utilizing ensemble learning techniques, the project predicted the probability of Alzheimer's Disease based on the gathered dataset.

## How to Use

1. **Game Installation:** Install the Alzheimer's Disease Detection mobile game on your device.
2. **Gameplay:** Engage with the game to test your navigating skills.
3. **Analysis:** The system will generate predictions regarding the probability of Alzheimer's Disease based on your interaction with the game.

## Conclusion

The Alzheimer's Disease Detection project stands at the intersection of technology and healthcare, offering a proactive approach to the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease. By combining mobile gaming, data generation, and ensemble learning, the project contributes to the ongoing efforts in improving healthcare diagnostics.
